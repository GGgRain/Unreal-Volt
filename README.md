# Volt - The Animation Library for Unreal Slate Architecture

Volt is a simple, modular library powered by various UObject-based modules that can manipulate slate properties as you want in both runtime and editor. 

This library is part of Joint Project, a powerful full-modular conversation scripting framework, especially Volt took place in the editor module to animate the slates on the editor without limitation on the production and performances. 

This project is open source and will be uploaded to GitHub very soon, allowing you to fork or pull something together. GitHub will get the updates more frequently, so make sure to visit there if you want to get up-to-date with your files. Or, you can visit our discord to get any news for the new updates.

The distribution of the project intends to make you able to use it on your editor for the visual part. Let's make Unreal's editor beautiful! 

We are still making a description for the plugin. Please keep in touch. If you have any questions related to this, please visit our discord. (https://discord.gg/DzNFax2aBS)
